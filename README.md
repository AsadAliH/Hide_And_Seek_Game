# Hide_And_Seek_Game

DOM manipulation and javascript practice.

In this game you are given 3 doors, behind one is a robot, your object is to open the 2 doors without the robot and maintain as high a streak of victories that you can.
Once you open all 3 doors, the button underneath the scores will allow you to reset and go again, win or lose, each victory will be recorded and added to current streak.
Beneath that using EventListener, i have added a button that when clicked will display a secondary box that will take you to this git repository.
